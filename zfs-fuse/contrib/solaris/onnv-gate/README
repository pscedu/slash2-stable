Getting files from onnv

These scripts are here to get updates from onnv (opensolaris repository).
First you need a clone of the whole onnv repository, it will create a big
onnv-gate directory - mine currently reports 586 Mb, so it takes a long time to
clone, and quite a lot of space (place this on a compressed zfs filesystem !) 

Anyway, a good place for this is in zfs/contrib so that these scritps will be
at the root of your onnv-gate copy. When you are ready, type :

hg clone ssh://anon@hg.opensolaris.org/hg/onnv/onnv-gate

and wait.

After that the log script will give you the hg log for the zfs files. If you
want to import one of the hg commits in our git repository, copy the changeset
reference (for example 11026:e8e10df16a8f), and run :
./export 11026:e8e10df16a8f
It should create an export-11026 file in your zfs directory (the root of the
zfs git repository).
Now go to this directory and run
perl handle_hg.pl export-11026
The script will convert the filenames in the export file on the fly, prepare a
git log message, extract the author, ignore all the files which are not useful
for our zfs-fuse version, and apply the diff from the export file to the
current git repository. If the diff applies without error, it will
automatically commit it, using the log message and the author extracted from
the export file. Otherwise it will print the commands to use to revert the
patch to return to the previous state, or the command to commit once you have
fixed the problems.
Also the script will report if it finds any rename and will ask for manual
intervention. The only thing to do is to type "git rename file1 file2" (the
files to give are printed), and then remove the rename from the export file.
