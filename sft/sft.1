.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides a few handy capabilities for file I/O.
It can read, checksum, and write data and can provide basic performance
metrics about the activity it performs.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl B
Display a bandwidth meter during progress.
.It Fl b Ar bufsz
Change the default file chunk size to
.Ar bufsz .
Defaults to 32768.
.It Fl c
Compute and display a checksum over the entire file contents.
.It Fl d
Use direct I/O
.Pq Li O_DIRECT
for read or write I/O.
.It Fl K
When used with
.Fl K ,
display checksums of each file chunk
.Pq to control chunk size, see Fl b .
.It Fl O Ar offset
Start processing each specified file at the given
.Ar offset .
.It Fl P
Perform piecewise processing of each file specified on the command line.
The default behavior is to perform processing sequentially until
completion of each file specified instead of round-robin processing.
.It Fl R
Recursively process all files and subdirectories in any directories
specified on the command line.
.It Fl s Ar size
Specify the total I/O
.Ar size
to perform on each file specified on the command line.
.It Fl t Ar nthr
Specify the number of processing threads that should perform I/O on each
file.
Defaults to 1.
.It Fl v
Verbosely display ongoing operations.
.It Fl w
Perform write operation over the file contents with random junk.
The default amount of data to write is the current existing file size
which may be overridden with the
.Fl s
option.
The default operation is to read file contents.
.It Fl Z
Check if a file chunk is composed of entirely zeroes and display
a indicator
.Pq Sq Z
for any such chunks
.Pq see Fl K .
Defaults to 32768.
