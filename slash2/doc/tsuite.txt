SLASH2 Functionality Tests for Tsuite

512-byte dd - this stresses the biorq subsystem in the client.
dd if=/dev/zero of=$S2MP/outfile count=1M

[svn] checkout and build of the SLASH2 tree.
cd $S2MP && svn co svn+ssh://frodo/cluster/svn/projects && cd projects/slash2 && make build

Linux kernel untar and build

md5s of all files should be compared against those from a local build.

In multi-client configurations, the sizes and attributes of all resulting files should be compared.

IOZone default test

Stresses certain aspects of sliod and the client.
Expect to see heavy backlog of CRC updates.
cd $S2MP && iozone -a

Simple append test
fn=$S2MP/tf && echo line1 >> $fn && echo line2 >> $fn && echo line3 >> $fn && echo line4 >> $fn; wc -l $fn

FIO tests
Heavy create test: Stresses the fidcache on the client and mds and the bmap lease infrastructure on the mds and sliod. (Note: that all write lease releases occur through sliod). This is a good test for finding leaks in the fidcache which may be due to improperly unref'ing bmap's.
Single threaded, large file create and readback. Fio tests data integrity on readback.
Multi-threaded, large file create and readback
In multi-client configurations, the sizes and attributes of all resulting files should be compared. This will help find bugs in the client attribute caching and sliod / mds file size updating. Note that before attributes can be compared all clients must wait for the cache timeout period to expire.
