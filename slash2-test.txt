Basic tests
-----------

   * kernel compile
   * self build
   * tar over ssh
   * iozone -a

Run the above four tests in a loop for at least four hours.  Remove all files and repeat.
Ideally, the process should continue for 24 hours.

Unit tests
----------

1. Build sliod on FreeBSD 9.0 with gmake.

2. If zfs-fuse is changed, try to create a new ZFS pool.

3. Check out two slash2 source trees, one in slash2, the other in a different file system.
   Then do a recursive diff -dur -x .git comparison.  This can catch readlink regressions.

4. Check out a slash2 source tree on one IOS, replicate it to another IOS. Then take the
   first IOS offline and build the source tree. This makes sure that msctl functionality
   and basic replication work.

   It also makes sure that the client can skip the down IOS quickly.

5. Force MDS to always return DIO bmap lease (sys.force_dio=1) and do a self build.

   self-build non DIO mode:

	real	3m46.075s
	user	4m42.471s
	sys	1m33.065s

   self-build DIO mode:

	real	4m55.931s
	user	4m45.384s
	sys	1m35.727s

   Also make sure that this test finishes within 4 minutes to detect possible performance
   regression. Note that DIO is slower than the non DIO case.

6. After all tests are done, run slmctl -sc and check the reference count of resources to
   make sure there are no leaks.

7. Set up a logical I/O server, and make sure that I/O does spread across multiple I/O servers.

8. Create a file on one I/O server, disable write on it, and try to overwrite the file after
   waiting for leases and caches have expired.

9. Run bigfile.sh.
